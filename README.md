# Closed Loop - IMU using python3

### Sensor
A sensor is an electronic device used in concert with other electronics designed to detect changes in an environment, such as light, sound or movement. The sensor then passes that information back to the electronic devices to which it is connected.

### IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit

An IMU is a specific type of sensor that measures angular rate, force and sometimes magnetic field. IMUs are composed of a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope, which would be considered a 6-axis IMU. They can also include an additional 3-axis magnetometer, which would be considered a **9-axis IMU**.  

Technically, the term “IMU” refers to just the sensor, but IMUs are often paired with sensor fusion software which combines data from multiple sensors to provide measures of orientation and heading. In common usage, the term “IMU” may be used to refer to the combination of the sensor and sensor fusion software; this combination is also referred to as an AHRS (Attitude Heading Reference System).

    Price: Rs.600 - 700.00

Combination of Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer and temperature measuring sensor.
### Accelerometer

An accelerometer is a tool that measures proper acceleration. Proper acceleration is the acceleration (**the rate of change of velocity**) of a body in its own instantaneous rest frame; this is different from coordinate acceleration, which is acceleration in a fixed coordinate system.

Accelerometers can be used to measure vehicle acceleration. Accelerometers can be used to measure vibration on cars, machines, buildings, process control systems and safety installations. They can also be used to measure seismic activity, inclination, machine vibration, dynamic distance and speed with or without the influence of gravity. 

    Unit - m/S^2 - metre per second square

### Gyroscope

![Gyroscope](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Gyroscope_operation.gif/220px-Gyroscope_operation.gif)

A gyroscope  is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity. It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation (spin axis) is free to assume any orientation by itself. When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum.

    Unit - degrees/second (or) RPS - Revolutions Per Second

### Magnetometer

A magnetometer is a device that measures magnetic field or magnetic dipole moment. Different types of magnetometers measure the direction, strength, or relative change of a magnetic field at a particular location. A compass is one such device, one that measures the direction of an ambient magnetic field, in this case, the Earth's magnetic field.

    unit - mT - milli Tesla or micro Tesla

### INS - Inertial Navigation System

An inertial navigation system (INS) is a navigation device that uses a computer, motion sensors (accelerometers) and rotation sensors (gyroscopes) to continuously calculate by dead reckoning the position, the orientation, and the velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external references.

#### Axes Orientation of the sensors
